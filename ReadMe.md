# Welcome to Mr Poll, Open Sourced.

Mr Poll is coded in the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev), you can download Go by clicking [here](https://go.dev/dl/). \
After downloading Go you will have to install the required packages for this Project:
```shell
go mod download
```
\
A [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) runtime is required to run some scripts in this project, you can use [BunJS](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/). \
NodeJS cannot be used standalone as it does not support [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) but you can use [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node). \

## Disclaimer 
This is an unfinished project and is likely not the actual code that the Mr Poll bot is running at this time. The aim of this project is to replace Mr Poll's code with a system that is stable and reliable while having a low memory footprint, hence why Go was chosen.
